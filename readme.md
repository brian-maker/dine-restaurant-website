Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm brian
 
Dine restaurant website

This is a solution for the Dine restraurant website page from frontend mentor

This project was a nice way to test my css skills on layout and positionings.

Dine restaurat website is a two page website that showcases the restaurants capabilities and what they offer.

The first page shows images from the restaurant and has buttons for reservation that when clicked take you to the second page where you can book for a session at the website.

The second page of the website has reservation form that enables a customer to book for:
    the number of people
    the date you want to visit 
    the time you are going to visit

The reservation form shows error messages when invalid information is entered.

The project has a challenging layout especially with the positioning of the images and the background patterns.

A live demo for this website can be found here https://dine-resturant-website.netlify.app/
